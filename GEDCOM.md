# GEDCOM

GEDCOM files deal with four(?) primary components:
* INDI (individual) – naming and personal data
* EVEN (event) – events, personal and family
* SOUR (source) – sources and documentation
* FAM (family) – the mappings and connections between individuals

In addition, GEDCOM files will have a HEAD (header) that will also provide information on the format and version being used
as well as the SUBM (submitter) of that file
