# Family

“You can choose your friends, but you can’t choose your family.”  
—(proverb)

“The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other’s life.”  
—Richard Bach

“[We are] working with the same raw material as exists in the animal world, but [we] can conceptualize and categorize it to serve social ends.”  
—Robin Fox

## Kinship

Requires research, but anthropological [kinship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship) looks to be a better source of relationship terminology than genealogy terms. Kinship covers consanguinity (relationship by blood), affinity (relationship by marriage), and fictive kingship (kinship ties not by blood or marriage, ex. milk-mother, godparents, guru in India, foster care, brothers-in-arms, etc.)

## Background

[Social network analysis software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis_software)  
[Genealogy software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy_software)

Most network [graphing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) formats default to defining vertices (nodes, actors) and edges (links, relationships). Most file formats appear to be text-based and relatively compact, [DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) files and [GraphML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML)(GraphViz) appear common.
* ex. SocNetV uses GraphML for files and GraphViz for rendering/plotting

[SocNetV: Supported Formats](https://socnetv.org/docs/formats.html) – showing examples and supported tags (defaults to GraphML)

Other formats
* GEDCOM
  * > GEDCOM does not explicitly support data representation of many types of close interpersonal relationships,
    > such as same-sex marriages, domestic partnerships, cohabitation, polyamory or polygamy. Such relationships
    > can only be represented using the generic ASSO tag used for any type of relationship.

* [Ahnentafel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahnentafel)
* [Gramps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramps)
  * families only have two parents: father/parent1 and mother/parent2
  * support for formal reference citations (ex. Zotero) appears inconsistent (and no support for CSL)
